  According to Wikipedia, “Digital nomads are a type of people who use telecommunications technologies to earn a living and, more generally, conduct their life in a nomadic manner.”. Okay, let's try.

In August of 2018, I had one of the best experiences of my life, traveling to Canada and the United States with my fiancee. At first, I had two goals with this trip: to participate in [SIGGRAPH](https://s2018.siggraph.org) as a volunteer and take a vacation. That's how I planned the trip while buying the ticket in January of that year.

But since life is dynamic and things do not always happen as planned, in April I faced a difficult situation where I worked at the time and I got to the point of asking the bills which gave me some fear because I still had bills to pay and my life had turned upside down. To summarize, two months later I was able to establish myself in a freelance job this time working remotely.

Since my first week, I tried to explain my situation with the trip already programmed and to understand how the company saw my situation with SIGGRAPH, after all, I planned the trip before to arrange this work. It turns out that I was well received because of my volunteer work at the conference and the trip could happen, however, no longer as a vacation trip and that was when the first possibility of doing **Digital Nomadism** arose.

> [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad), “Digital nomads are a type of people who use telecommunications technologies to earn a living and, more generally, conduct their life in a nomadic manner.”

It is a dream of concept and much desired by my generation that wants to live traveling. Well, I was super excited and quite anxious (side effect of three stressful years of my life). I started planning: for twenty days I would work while traveling and would have to balance my work hours during the conference.

I arranged my travel dates with my team and made the most of my trips occurring on weekends or evenings. Because I was in a different time zone, I would wake up early to work (at 5:00 AM) and go on with my schedule until lunch, if I did not have meetings scheduled for the afternoon, I would put my backpack on and go out touring, returning to lodging as late as he could. Upon arriving I worked another hour or two or finishing an important task (which led to a clear night in the last days of my trip).

This was my routine: alternating work and tourism whenever possible. It was a tiring but fantastic experience.

One thing that went through my head was that I had never done such a routine and obviously I just followed it because my travel time was short (and the dollar very high!) So I had to optimize all my resources: I slept little, ate cheap (and badly) and lived in a hurry. It was the price paid for inexperience.

I would have done it all over again if I could, I know I was doing the best I could. But for the future I suggest to be attentive to the following aspects:

#### **DO NOT HAVE A ROUTINE AFFECTS YOUR PRODUCTIVITY**
During the trip I was very difficult to enter the state of flow and consequently took longer than expected in some of my tasks, which gave me a bad feeling of worthlessness and that sometimes left me depressed, also disrupting my tourism. For this to work out, you have to behave like a local resident and have a healthy routine.

#### **GOOD FOOD IS FUNDAMENTAL**
Living fast food just because it's cheaper will destroy you anywhere in the world. I missed home-made food.

#### **RESTING THE BODY AND MIND MUST BE PART OF THE ROUTINE**
I ended the trip extremely tired and still had to face more than 20 hours of travel back to Brazil, this was one of the factors so that I could not enter the state of flow and ended up affecting my trip in a general way since I needed of quite stimulating (coffee !!!) to stay attentive.

#### **"I WILL OPEN THE COMPUTER IN THIS STARBUCK AND WORK SOME HOURS" IS AN ILLUSION**
It did not work with me. Slow Internet and a lot of noise frustrated my concentration and soon I abandoned this way of working. Work from home or in places built with the intention of giving you a sense of being at work. Starbucks to read emails and look there.

In the end, the cons are quite small and easy to solve with the experience and I will definitely insist on digital nomadism in the future, even with the tiredness I felt contemplated with everything I was living and still managed to work at a good level and extremely motivated by account of the opportunity he was having.

The learning I carry from this experience is that being a digital nomad is not being a tourist while you work, but being native anywhere in the world no matter where you come from, a world citizen who works without frontiers.
